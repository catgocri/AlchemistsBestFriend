# PotionCraft Alchemists Best Friend
Love doing challenges in Potion Craft? Hate waiting for ingredients to grow or for the merchants to sell them? This mod is for you. Alchemists Best Friend adds the ability to spawn in ingredients and salts at the press of one button. Also adds some challenge features to the game such as adding one of every ingredient. I might add more challenge options in the future.
### Keybinds
- Pressing `Alpha 1` on your keyboard will give you `1000` of each ingredient.
- Pressing `Alpha 2` on your keyboard will give you `1000` of each salt. (NOTE: THIS DOES INCLUDE THE `UNRELEASED SALTS`.)
- Pressing `Alpha 3` on your keyboard will clear your inventory and give you `1` of each ingredient, incase you want to do a no duplicate ingredient challenge.
- Pressing `Alpha 0` on your keyboard will clear your inventory.
## Installation
This mod uses BepInEx 5! BepInEx is a mod loader, basically it is what puts the edited code into the game.
- Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract the zip file.
- Drag the extracted folder into your Potion Craft folder, you should be able to find the Potion Craft folder at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Potion Craft`
- Run Potion Craft once with BepInEx installed.
- Download the mod from the [GitHub](https://github.com/catgocri/AlchemistsBestFriend/releases) page.
- Drag `potioncraft-alchemistsBF.dll` into `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- You are good to go!
## Deinstallation
Uninstalling this mod is as easy as deleting one file, you don't even need to delete [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)!
- Navigate to `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- Remove `potioncraft-alchemistsBF.dll` from the folder.
- You are done!
